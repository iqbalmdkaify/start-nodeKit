### Project Structure

#### 1. Detailed Structure

- **`controllers/`**: Contains the logic for handling requests and responses. Each file typically corresponds to a specific page or feature.
- **`database/`**: Includes database connection logic and configuration, such as setting up Mongoose for MongoDB.
- **`models/`**: Contains the database schemas and models used in the application.
- **`public/`**: Stores static assets like CSS, JavaScript, and images. These files are served directly to the client.
- **`views/`**: Holds EJS templates for rendering dynamic HTML content.

This structure helps in maintaining a clean separation of concerns, making the application easier to manage and extend.

#### 2. Customization

You can customize the boilerplate to fit your needs by modifying the existing code or adding new routes, views, and static files.

#### 3. Adding a New Page

1. Create a new route and controller: Add a new file in the `controllers` directory.
2. Create a new view: Create a new HBS(handlebars) file in the `views/` directory.
3. Link the route to the controller: Define the new route in `index.js` and associate it with the controller logic.

#### 4. Working with Handlebars

This project uses Handlebars (`hbs`) as the templating engine for rendering views. If you are unfamiliar with Handlebars, you can learn more about it here: [Handlebars Documentation](https://handlebarsjs.com/).

Handlebars allows you to create dynamic templates with features like helpers, partials, and block expressions, which can be very useful for rendering complex views.

#### 5. Environment Variables

You can set environment variables in the `.env` file. For example:

<code>PORT=3000</code>
