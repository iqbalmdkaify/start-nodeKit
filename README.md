### Project Structure

```
start-node-kit/
├── controllers/       # Application logic and controllers
├── database/          # Database connection and configurations
├── models/            # Database models and schemas
├── public/            # Static files (images, CSS, etc.)
├── views/             # View templates (HBS files)
├── .gitignore         # Files and directories to ignore in Git
├── package.json       # Project metadata and dependencies
├── package-lock.json  # Dependency lock file
└── index.js           # Main application file
```

#### 1. Detailed Structure

- **`controllers/`**: Contains the logic for handling requests and responses. Each file typically corresponds to a specific page or feature.
- **`database/`**: Includes database connection logic and configuration, such as setting up Mongoose for MongoDB.
- **`models/`**: Contains the database schemas and models used in the application.
- **`public/`**: Stores static assets like CSS, JavaScript, and images. These files are served directly to the client.
- **`views/`**: Holds EJS templates for rendering dynamic HTML content.

This structure helps in maintaining a clean separation of concerns, making the application easier to manage and extend.

#### 2. Customization

You can customize the boilerplate to fit your needs by modifying the existing code or adding new routes, views, and static files.

#### 3. Adding a New Page

1. Create a new route and controller: Add a new file in the `controllers` directory.
2. Create a new view: Create a new HBS(handlebars) file in the `views/` directory.
3. Link the route to the controller: Define the new route in `index.js` and associate it with the controller logic.

#### 4. Environment Variables

You can set environment variables in the `.env` file. For example:

<code>PORT=3000</code>

#### 5. Contributing
